# The Scientist and Engineer‘’s Guide to Digital Signal Processing

"***The Scientist and Engineer‘’s Guide to Digital Signal Processing***" is writed By Steven W. Smith, Ph.D. And this is my favorite book about DSP. There was no Chinese version of the book, so many Chinese couldn't enjoy the author's work as much as I did, and it didn't match the author's intention to post it free on the site (http://www.dspguide.com/) .

The project was written for those who have difficulty reading English and  whose native language is Chinese. Because of my limitted English skill, there will be many grammatical mistake.If you find mistakes, please issue it.

If you have time and happy to translate it for more chinese, you could word with me to maintain the project.



“***科学家和工程师的数字信号处理指南*** ”是史蒂芬·w·史密斯博士写的，这也是我最喜欢的关于DSP的书。这本书没有中文版，所以很多中国人不能像我一样享受作者的成果，也不符合作者在网站上免费发表作品的初衷 ( http://www.dspguide.com/ )。

该项目是为那些英语阅读困难，母语为汉语的人编写的。由于我的英语水平有限，会有很多语法错误。如果你发现错误，请提交 issue。

如果你有时间并且愿意为了更多的中国人翻译，你可以和我一起维护这个项目。
